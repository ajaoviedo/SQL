# SQL Winforms App
This is a simple Winforms App that allows you to connect to an SQL database (SQL Server Express).  I used C# to make this app and .NET Framework 4.7.2.  The app starts with a form that allows you to connect to a server (my local computer) and choose which database you would like to connect to.  It then allows you to select a table from the database and read it, delete all values, or insert values.
